Lingua/PT/Words2Nums version 1.04
=================================

Lingua::PT::Words2Nums - Converts Portuguese words to numbers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Lingua::PT::Words2Nums;

  $result = num2word("cinco");
  # $result now holds 5

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Words2Nums converts Portuguese words to numbers (works with numbers
ranging from 0 to 999.999.999.999.999.999).

Not all possible ways to write a number have been implemented (some
people write "nove mil novecentos e um", some people write "nove mil,
novecentos e um"; Words2Nums currently supports only the first way,
without commas; also, the word "bilião" is supported, but not "bilhão").
