Lingua/PT/Words2Nums version 1.03
=================================

Converts Portuguese words to numbers.

  use Lingua::PT::Words2Nums;

  $result = num2word("cinco");
  # $result now holds 5

(works up to 999.999.999.999.999.999; does not support negative numbers)

Not all possible ways to write a number have been implemented (some
people write "nove mil novecentos e um", some people write "nove mil,
novecentos e um"; Words2Nums currently supports only the first way,
without commas; also, the word "bilião" is supported, but not "bilhão").
